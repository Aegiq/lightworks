The following features/improvements are planned to be added to Lightworks in the future.

1) Expansion of emulator beyond permanent calculation, adding some of the alternate algorithms designed to improve computation & sampling speed (Clifford, SLOS, etc...).
2) Improvement of display method to add option to adjust display style beyond the current 'Aegiq' colour theme that is used.
3) Conversion from qubit to photonic systems - potentially using an existing framework suggest as Qiskit.
4) Hardware job submission.
