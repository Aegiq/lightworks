Tutorials
=========

In this section is a number of tutorials which aim to demonstrate how Lightworks can be utilized.  

Contents
--------

#. :doc:`circuit_building` : Demonstrates each of the included circuit components within Lightworks and how these can be added.
#. :doc:`using_parameters` : Shows how parameters can be utilised to simplify modification of a circuit, particularly during optimizations. 
#. :doc:`error_simulation` : Introduces photonic errors such as loss, photon distinguishability and detection errors into simulations.
#. :doc:`qubit` : In this tutorial the Lightworks qubit module is used to define and simulate transformations on dual-rail encoded qubits.
