Lightworks |release| Documentation 
==================================

Introduction
------------

Lightworks is designed to enable algorithms to be development and implemented on photonic quantum computing hardware. Also provided with Lightworks is an emulator, which features a set of local simulation tools for the testing of a provided configuration before hardware execution.

Where To Begin
--------------

To get started, check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information on how Lightworks can be utilised, including how to :ref:`install <installation>` the project. 

Once setup, there is then a set of tutorials for familiarization with the module, and some :doc:`examples/index` to demonstrate the different ways in which the SDK can be applied. 

Note that the following documentation is split into two components, the SDK and the emulator. The SDK components are those that are generally used to build and define a job and the emulator components are the simulation tools for testing those jobs on classical computational capacity.
