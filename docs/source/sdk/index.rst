The SDK components are those used for defining an experiment or algorithm which is to be computed. Central to this is the :doc:`../sdk_reference/circuit`, which determines the exact configuration of the QPU which is to be used for the algorithm.

In the following sections, some of the main functionality of the Circuit and other components is discussed.
